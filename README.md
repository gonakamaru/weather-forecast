# 📘 Weather Chart → Forecast → Salesforce
A compact proof-of-concept that ingests JMA surface analysis PDFs, extracts a forecast using LLaVA, and stores the results in Salesforce.

---

## 🌤️ Project Overview
This project converts a single JMA weather chart PDF into structured content that can be stored inside Salesforce Developer Edition:

1. **Process the input PDF**
2. **Generate a standard and a small preview PNG**
3. **Extract a short forecast summary using LLaVA**
4. **Upload everything into Salesforce** (original PDF hash, preview PNG, forecast text)

It’s a small script, but touches a wide range of skills:
PDF tooling, image conversion, LLM usage, orchestration design, and Salesforce REST integration.

---

## 🧩 Project Goals
- Keep the architecture modular and testable
- Maintain a clean separation of concerns
- Store outputs efficiently to stay within Salesforce limits
- Make the code easy to extend as new ideas come up
- Keep the repo tidy and versioned with meaningful git tags

---

## 🏗 Current State (MVP)
The script runs end-to-end and performs all major tasks:

- Downloads or ingests the PDF
- Converts page to PNG producing a standard and a small preview version
- Gets a forecast summary from LLaVA
- Pushes the results into Salesforce

This marks the initial versioning point (`v0.1.0`).

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Refactor: move PDF/PNG logic into dedicated classes
- Add pipeline orchestrator for clearer flow
- Expand tests for parent/child class structure
- Improve CLI experience
- Track tasks using GitHub Issues and (new) GitHub Project board
